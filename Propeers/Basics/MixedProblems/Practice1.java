// Problem statement
// Ninja just got an offer letter from a reputable company. The company sent him an offer letter along with the salary bifurcation.

// In that bifurcation,Total Salary was not mentioned but instead a ‘basicSalary’ and an upper case character representing grade was mentioned, depending on which the Total Salary is calculated.

// Help Ninja in calculating his total salary, where total salary is defined as:

// ‘totalSalary’ = ‘basic’ + ‘hra’ + ‘da’ + ‘allowance’ - ‘pf’
// The above terms are as follows:

// ‘hra’ = 20% of ‘basic’
// ‘da’ = 50% of ‘basic’
// ‘allowance’ = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
// ‘allowance’ = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
// ‘allowance’ = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
// ‘pf’ = 11% of ‘basic’.
// Note :

// Round off the ‘totalSalary’ and then print the integral part only.

// 'x.5' type values will always be round up, for example, 1.5, 2.5 will be round off to 2, 3 respectively.
// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Constraints :
// 0 <= 'basicSalary' <= 7 * (10 ^ 5)

// Time Limit: 1 sec.
// Sample Input 1 :
// 2
// 10000 A
// 4567 B
// Sample Output 1 :
// 17600
// 8762
// Explanation for Sample Input 1:
// Test Case 1:
// We have been given the basic salary as Rs. 10000. We need to calculate the hra, da and pf. 
// Now when we calculate each of the, it turns out to be:
// hra =  20% of Rs. 10000 = Rs. 2000
// da = 50% od Rs. 10000 = Rs. 5000
// pf = 11% of Rs. 10000 = Rs. 1100

// Since, the grade is 'A', we take an allowance of Rs. 1700.
// On substituting these values to the formula of totalSalary, we get Rs. 17600 and now rounding it off will result in Rs. 17600 and hence the Answer.

// Test Case 2:
// We have been given the basic salary as Rs. 4567. We need to calculate the hra, da and pf. 
// Now when we calculate each of the, it turns out to be:
// hra =  20% of Rs. 4567 = Rs. 913.4
// da = 50% od Rs. 4567 = Rs. 2283.5
// pf = 11% of Rs. 4567 = Rs. 502.37

// Since, the grade is 'B', we take an allowance of Rs. 1500.
// On substituting these values to the formula of totalSalary, we get Rs. 8761.53 and now rounding it off will result in Rs. 8762 and hence the Answer.
// Sample Input 2 :
// 2
// 1500 B
// 5000 C
// Sample Output 2 :
// 3885
// 9250
